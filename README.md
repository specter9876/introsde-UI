## ARCHITECTURE

As we can see in the Fig. 1 the virtual life coach project is composed into 3 main block:
* User Interface
* System Logic
* Data sources

Into these block we fund 5 web service + UI run locally. Among these web services 4 are SOAP and 1 REST:

* DATABASE SERVICE-A SOAP web services that communicates directly with the Database (SQLite) and it is responsible for management of all data model and query. 
* ADAPTER SERVICES-A REST web service that communicate with different data sources: retrieves and expose information useful for services. In detail this layer interacts with two external API (Food data, http://api.edamam.com, Quote data, https://theysaidso.com/)
* STORAGE SERVICES-A SOAP web services that manages and handle all data request, in detail it talks with database web service and adapter web services 
* BUSINESS LOGIC SERVICES-A SOAP web service. The core of project responsible of decision making, controls and calculation  (in example goals control)
* PROCESS CENTRIC SERVICES-A SOAP web service that serve all requests coming directly from users (from application interface). These are the gateway to all other modules/services in an application context. This layer is doing nothing but redirecting a request to a proper underlying service or a set of services.
* USER INTERFACE-JAVAfX application, it is run locally provides service coming from process in a fashionable mode

## ENVIRORMENT

* IDE Eclipse (Apache ANT  and IVY)
* SQLite as database
* Ghitub
* Heroku (5 web services)
* 1 javafx application


##FUTURE WORKS

The virtual life coach is an individual project work, it can be easily extend by:
* adding more goals (simple create a goal marked as admin)
* creating an admin login to control and manage data
* add security checks like input sanitization to avoid sql injection or XSS
* upgrade quote by using a pricing external quote service


# INTROSDE-UI

## CODE

A minimalistic but complete Javafx user interface, consist into:
* a login page (StartingPageController.java), the classic login page with username and password.
* a sign up page (RegisterController.java), used to create a new user.
* a Doctor page (HomePageController.java), used to add and see measures.
* a Coach page (HomePageController.java), used to add and see activity
* a Dietologist page (HomePageController.java), used to ask for food just for name or for calories bound
